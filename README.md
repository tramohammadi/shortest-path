# Shortest Path

A Python implementation for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph using pathfinding algorithms.

## Overview

This project provides algorithms to compute the shortest path between two points in a graph structure. It includes a graph representation stored in JSON format and Python implementation of pathfinding logic.

## Features

- **Graph-based pathfinding**: Find optimal routes between nodes
- **JSON-based graph definition**: Easy-to-understand and flexible graph representation
- **Efficient algorithms**: Optimized pathfinding implementation

## Requirements
- Python3
- Matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tramohammadi/shortest-path.git
cd shortest-path
```

2. Run the Python Script:

```bash
python path.py
```


## Usage

```python
# Import the path module
from path import *

# Load your graph from map.json
# Use the provided functions to find the shortest path
